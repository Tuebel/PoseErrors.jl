They prefer Maximum Symmetry-Aware Surface Distance (MSSD) over Averade Average Distance of Model Points with indistinguishable views (ADD-S = ADI), because they can yield low errors with bad visual alignment. Moreover, ADD-S is dominated by higher-frequency surface parts (e.g. a Thread). Maximum distances do not suffer from the surface sampling density as much.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PoseErrors.jl","title":"PoseErrors.jl","text":"However, annotating the symmetries is tedious and heavily depends on the choice of coordinate frames. For a large set of objects like surgical instruments which are not exported in a standardized / symmetry aligned frame, this is impractical. So, similar to (Gorschl√ºter et al. 2022) we use ADD-S and VDS (Hodan et. al 2016) as metrics.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Setup-for-BOP-dataset-evaluation","page":"PoseErrors.jl","title":"Setup for BOP dataset evaluation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"PoseErrors.jl","title":"PoseErrors.jl","text":"Extract the BOP datasets as described on their website.
